                Here's how it works: you'll answer a series of questions that ask you to rate your friends on a scale from chaotic to lawful and from evil to good. Based on your answers, we'll generate a visual representation of where you and your friends fall on the alignment chart.
                Will you be a chaotic good rebel, a lawful evil mastermind, or something in between? There's only one way to find out! Take the quiz with your friends and compare your results to see how you all match up.

                So what are you waiting for? Take the alignment quiz now and find out where you and your friends stand on the classic D&D alignment chart!
