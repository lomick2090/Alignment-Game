# Alignment-Game
This is a personal project to create a game for a group of friends to participate in.

The goal is to have each player have a profile of sorts, with their name and avatar. Once they set that up,
they can vote on other friends in the group, the voting consists of voting on a scale from 1 to 10 the lawfulness of 
the other members and then the evil/good of other users. Afterwards an alignment chart is made from the data provided.
